# OVH hook for dehydrated ACME client

This a hook for [dehydrated](https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated) (a ACME client, compatible with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates provider) that allows you to use [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/) DNS records to respond to `dns-01` challenges. Requires Python and your OVH API Credentials being set in the ovh.conf file.

Let's Encrypt validation is usually done by file: you will have to add a specified file into a specific folder, or even you will have to start Let's Encrypt program instead of your web-server to serve the validation file.
With DNS validation, you don't have to touch anything on your web-server, you just have to modify a record on your domain name DNS entries, and you're all set.

OVH Hook for [dehydrated](https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated) take care of that part: it will automatically connect to the OVH API and modify your DNS record in order to match the Let's Encrypt challenge. At the end, you will receive your SSL certificate without any connection to your web-server !


Based on [kappataumu](https://github.com/kappataumu/letsencrypt-cloudflare-hook) work for a competitor DNS validation hook.

## Setup

- Clone the [dehydrated repository](https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated)
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated
```

- Create a directory for the OVH hook, and clone the [OVH hook repository](https://github.com/eachtime/dehydrated-ovh-py3.git)
```
$ cd dehydrated
$ mkdir hooks
$ git clone https://github.com/eachtime/dehydrated-ovh-py3.git hooks/ovh
```

- Install dependencies (python libraries)
```
$ pip install -r hooks/ovh/requirements.txt
```

- Edit the OVH API configuration file with your API credentials
```
$ cp hooks/ovh/ovh.conf.dist ./ovh.conf
$ editor ovh.conf
```

If you don't have any API credentials, you can create some using the [official OVH credentials page](https://eu.api.ovh.com/createToken/?GET=/domain/zone/*&POST=/domain/zone/*&DELETE=/domain/zone/*). Take care to `Validity` parameter: if you select a value that have an expiration date, you will need to regenerate new credentials.


## Usage

[dehydrated](https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated) provides an example configuration file ( `docs/example/config` ). To use OVH hook for your domains, just edit the configuration file, and configure:
- `HOOK` value with relative path to OVH hook script
- `CHALLENGETYPE` value with `dns-01`

Then, launch dehydrated with `--cron` option to generate/renew certificates.

Example:
```
$ cat config
HOOK=hooks/ovh/hook.py
CHALLENGETYPE="dns-01"

$ ./dehydrated -c
[ ... ]
 + Done!
```

dehydrated can be used without a configuration file, here is the way to start dehydrated with OVH hook:
```
$ ./dehydrated -s example.ovh.csr -d example.ovh -t dns-01 -k 'hooks/ovh/hook.py'
#
# !! WARNING !! No main config file found, using default config!
#

```


### Log level

Verbosity of OVH dehydrated hook can be configured using the ```level``` option:

```
$ cat config
# warn level will only display errors
HOOK=hooks/ovh/hook.py --level=warn

# info level will display all humans readable logs (info is the default value if level option is not provided)
HOOK=hooks/ovh/hook.py --level=info

# for all debugging log
HOOK=hooks/ovh/hook.py --level=debug
```

If ```level``` option is not provided, the default value ```info``` will be used.
